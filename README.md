# PokemonTypeChartRandomizerCrystal
A tool to Randomize the Type Chart Matchup Table of a PokÃ©mon Crystal ROM
Currently supports:
- Pokemon - Crystal Version (UE) (V1.0) [C][!].gbc `sha1: F4CD194BDEE0D04CA4EAC29E09B8E4E9D818C133`
- crystal-speedchoice-v7.2.gbc `sha1: 19AB11096EB2BA6BF9A8360093B2DDAE3E7ABBAB`

I would also suggest using Demki's tracker found here: https://demki.github.io/poketypechart/
Using that tracker, you can upload the spoiler log .csv file generated by this program to either:
 - Double check if you correctly kept track of the type matchups.
 - Or if you like, as an easy color coded way to peek at the spoiler log.

## How to use

IMPORTANT If you would like to randomize the Pokemon or moves / key items, please use those randomizers first THEN use this tool on the randomized ROMs

First run the '.exe' file from the dist.zip folder, Download from 'Releases'.

Click 'OpenROM' and select a clean or randomized 'Pokemon Crystal (UE) (V1.0)' or 'speedchoice-v7.1' gbc file.

Then select the settings you want for generating a random Type Chart using the Sliders.

If you would like a completely random type chart (very unbalanced) have each slider set to it's minimum and maximum values.

Click on 'Example=>' to generate an example of a possible chart to get a sense of what kind of chart you might get with the current settings.

Click on 'Randomize ROM' and specify the seed (or leave blank for a random one) and the name of the new .gbc file to generate a randomized Pokemon crystal ROM and spoiler log .csv file

If you would like to make a custom type chart click on the 'edit' check mark box and use the four buttons on top to modify the current type chart however you wish.

Then click on 'Save ROM using Example Chart' to generate a ROM with a custom type chart.
